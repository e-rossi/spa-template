# This is a template SPA

This template will be used for future projects to get started quickly with a familiar stack

## Tech stack

- Vite
- React
- Typescript
- Tailwind
- ESLint
- Prettier

## Next steps

- Implement [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial)
- Choose and implement a Tailwind component library [Material Tailwind](https://www.material-tailwind.com/docs/react/guide/vite) maybe?
- Implement [AWS Amplify](https://docs.amplify.aws/javascript/deploy-and-host/frameworks/deploy-vite-site/) or [Google Firebase](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy#google-firebase) and setup a pipeline to deploy the app
- Experiment with auth, analytics, logging, observability and all that

## What about tests?

No.
